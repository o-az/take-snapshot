# Take Snapshot for Tendermint-based Chain

## Overview

### - Get accounts in a tendermint chain and get their native token balances

### - This is just an example, definitely not optimal. You should run your own if you want to do this at a full scale

---

#### - Make changes to constants.py and to main.py accordingly

#### - `getAddresses()` in `main.py` is where you want to tinker with counts and limits based on your needs

#### - addresses with 0 balance are filtered out
